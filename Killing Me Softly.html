            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see that you have manic depression.&rdquo;<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I was diagnosed with it, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I have it,&rdquo; Mikhael replied defensively.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If that is what you&rsquo;re inclined to believe, but I have your medical records here which state differently.&rdquo; She inputted a few commands on the flexible OLED screen that she was holding and a female voice devoid of emotion played from the speakers on the ceiling.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<i>Mikhael Andrushkiv&#8230; Male, aged 24&#8230; Ethnicity: Slavic&#8230;</i>&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The woman skipped to the section she desired.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<i>History of mania followed by clinical depression...Subversive&#8230; Must have annual psychiatric evaluations.</i>&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mikhael said something indiscernible under his breath, most likely derogatory. There was no use in arguing with her, he could only react.
                Mikhael avoided eye contact with the woman by staring at the halogen lights above. His mind drifted as the woman asked him more questions. The walls were an albicant white, a blandness which made him nauseous. Contrasting the bland walls of the suffocatingly small room were vibrant screens which levitated. Each one of the six levitating screens advertised drugs.<i> Where the consumer comes first-Heckler &amp; Deamon Laboratories. Live free, live medicated, live Aeolus- Aeolus Associated Research Company. Why be melancholic when you can be FastraZoidic?</i><br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When Mikhael glanced back at the woman she was typing something onto the screen. Was it about his noncompliance? His emaciated condition? Or the way he was sitting? He was positioned rather awkwardly, the gelid examining table and claustrophobic room left him in a state of malaise. He shifted his position to seem more natural, but could not stop the beads of perspiration forming.<br />
            She interrupted his thought: &ldquo;Now for this part of the examination you&rsquo;ll have to remove your shirt.&rdquo; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lifting his stained, burnt-hole scattered white shirt off fractured the dike holding back his past, allowing streams and eventually rivers of Mikhael to be scrutinized. The markings which symbolized his life, scars which captured his violent past and his Stamp of Nationality engendered a work colored by van Gogh and sculpted by Donatello.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite the ensemble of markings you have there, it's even more obscene in person that on your report,&rdquo; she said sneeringly, hoping to elicit a response. Mikhael did not protest. She pricked Mikhael&rsquo;s forearm with some sort of cannula and then flipped on one of the machines, which hummed to life. The three screens connected to the machine left hibernation as well. On the first screen was a medical history of Mikhael, every minute detail from his existence as a zygote to to-day. The middle screen would display his current condition once the blood sample finished being computed and recorded in a Kharkiv database. The last screen was dedicated to commands from Kharkiv. All three screens were turned away from Mikhael.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mikhael sighed. &ldquo;Just get these tests over with.&rdquo; He could feel his anxiety rising.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The woman stopped her work and studied Mikhael&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;I can understand some of it, considering your criminal past, but not all of it. The sna-.&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He cut her off. &ldquo;This one?&rdquo; He then pointed to his neck.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, the menacing snake. What does that mean?&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The serpent of drug addiction strangles me.&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She resumed with her work: loading more syringes, tuning dials on the machine. Whenever she glanced at Mikhael and then typed it exacerbated Mikhael&rsquo;s anxiety. Mikhael in response looked at her with contempt. <i>Jesus, just get the tests over with.</i> The results after a few seconds flashed on the middle screen. She studied the data.</p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Blood Sample #2A54A950D3FE results:<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Glc 147 mg/dL, Tsr 940 ng/dL, LDL C 1.87 mol/L, HDL C 1.2 mol/L, RBc 5.72 trillion cells/L, WBc 17.5 grams/dL, Pl 450 billion/L, RHR 68/bpm, Btp 98.5 F, Esr 28.2 pg/mL...</p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The most important information came at the end of the report.</p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Interpretation of #2A54A950D3FE results:<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;High levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, low levels of histone deacetylase 2, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and lack of enzymes Cytochrome P450 2D6 and Cytochrome P450 1A2 indicates patient is not taking prescribed medications 349-ADE-786-GLK, 778-KQU-KLO-222, 657-LNJ-342-KSL.</p>

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sedate patient with valium Dephedrine.</p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The woman was not the least bit apprehensive about the situation. She was experienced and confident she could handle a common criminal. She confirmed her belief when she saw Mikhael appearing to be staring off into nothingness. The woman snapped her fingers in front of his face to interrupt his daydream.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you been taking your medications?&rdquo; She prodded.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes you do, without it you&rsquo;re prone to hallucinations and psychosis.&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He didn&rsquo;t answer.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You absolutely need to be taking daily doses of Dehalcynate and Dexahephrine to calm yourself of your delusions.&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I beg to differ.&rdquo; He rolled his tongue mockingly for emphasis.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a psychopath without it.&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With this comment, Mikhael lowered his gaze from the woman to the floor.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I. Don&rsquo;t. Need it.&rdquo; Mikhael was irate.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You dare not oppose the law. Who do you think you are?&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;CHRIST I DON&rsquo;T NEED IT!&rdquo; He shrieked and began to tremble with rage.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Calm down or else I&rsquo;ll have to sedate you!&rdquo; She opened a cabinet next to a screen, and when she found the correct drug she moved to inject him with it. Before she could, Mikhael jumped up, tore off the instruments attached to him and headed for the door. The woman made a half hearted attempt to stop him, only because she knew once she reported this to her superiors at the MAIESF, he would be captured and imprisoned.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mikhael exited the room and sprinted down the connected corridor. Dumbfounded patients and medical professionals observed a strange man racing through the facility. The doors leading to other examining rooms passed by him in the seemingly endless corridor. He felt free by running, free of the chains of that room and free of that woman. He reached a junction where four corridors connected with his corridor, forming a commons area. There were various screens around the room, some advertising, some directions, some propaganda. He saw an exit.</p>

            <p class="title"> -cogito ergo sum-</p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The high definition cameras on the street witnessed a man burst out of the building. The audio receptors welded to street lights could hear his frantic breathing. The peculiar thing about the audio receptors was not their crisp clarity of recording, but the pretenses of their construction. Built ostensibly to record and locate gun shots, they were now used for surveillance. True, when the systems rolled out onto the city the rate of solved homicide cases tripled as police, and later the NKVD, could respond and apprehend suspects, but quickly criminals found other means of murder.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The information collected by the sensors was analyzed by a quantum computer in Donetsk, which used facial-recognition algorithms to cross-check criminal profiles in databases across the Eurasian Federation.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This would all bore Mikhael; he was not interested in the past, only with the present. So he was not interested his psychiatrist's reports, which would frighten any other person, for they outlined a sordid history of violence, depression, and drug abuse.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mikhael continued to sprint through the streets, passing workers commuting to their government jobs. The workers, for their part, continued on, without much thought, just like ants passing a dead body, for they were concerned only with their immediate needs.</p>

            <p class="title"> -in somnis veritas-</p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mikhael stood there on the moist, shifting ground. He watched the waves wash onto shore, the occasional passing vessel, sometimes just a speck near the horizon. He looked down. Sand. He looked to the north. More sand. He turned to the south. More sand. There were uncountable particles of sand on this beach, let alone all of the beaches of the world, and maybe even more on the beaches of some far off planet. Each particle of sand the remainder of the weathering of rocks and after so many years a particle of sand will have traveled to many more places than himself.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So he began walking down the coastline, cursing at the rolling waves which would splash Mikhael when they were the shadows of what they once were; echoes of the roaring, thunderous waves farther from land and closer to the deep sea. Aside from the patches of smog, the sky had a jacinthe hue to it. The brilliant luminescence in the sky radiated onto his exposed body.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mikhael toyed with the lighter in his pocket. He brought it out and began tossing it in the air, letting it crash onto his palm. He amused himself by doing this so he did not see the two figures in front of him.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A boy and his mother were standing there. The boy was holding a red balloon in one hand, his mother&rsquo;s hand in the other. They locked eyes with Mikhael, who was scrutinizing the mother until the boy spoke.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Are you happy mister?&rdquo; A candid question asked with a child&rsquo;s innocence.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course, are you happy?&rdquo; Mikhael replied warmly.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The boy glanced at his mother before replying. &ldquo;Sumtimes, sumtimes not.&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The balloon popped.</p>

            <p id="stars"> *&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp; *</p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mikhael jolted back to consciousness. Everything was black because of the cloth over his eyes. His hands were bound behind him; his mouth was gagged. He tasted the salty blood seeping from his gums. He was rested against a concrete wall. His shirt felt drenched. Sweat? No, it was blood. He inhaled deeply and pain shot from his ribs. Damn, were they broken? He hoped not.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Before he could analyze the events of the previous twenty-four hours, a door opened and the sounds of footsteps rushed in. Loud, menacing footsteps. The sounds echoed in the room.
                He thought about calling out to the footsteps, to demand an answer. Before he could, his head was slammed back against the wall behind him. Mikhael let out a thunderous expletive in response. Some time passed without any footsteps. Then his worst fears were realized.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>Oh fucking insects, ew fuck. Why are there insects on me? Please let the insects leave. Please, I&rsquo;m begging you. Why is there laughing. And the insects. Please stop the insects. It&rsquo;s so goddamn hot in here. Fuck.  Fuck fuck. Insec---</i><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why are you trying to run from us?&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Mikhael replied in tears.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Tell me how this feels,&rdquo; the voice asked, and Mikhael could feel more insects all over his body.
                <i>Please stop fuck please get those goddamn insects off of me. I can&rsquo;t. Fuck fuck fuck. I can&rsquo;t do this. Why is it so dark. My head hurts like a bitch. How long have I been in here? These fuckers keep biting and crawling and buzzing shit shit shit.</i></p>

            <p> This continued for some time.</p>

            <p id = "stars"> *&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp; *</p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I see that you have maniac depression. Where am I. Fuck. You&rsquo;re a psychopath without it. White walls, bright lights. You&rsquo;re a psychopath without it. Thank god the insects are gone. How do I get out of here? You&rsquo;re a psychopath without it. I can understand some of it, considering your criminal past, but not all of it. The ballon popped. You&rsquo;re a psychopath without it. Why am I here?<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You&rsquo;re a psychopath without it.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You&rsquo;re a psychopath without it.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You&rsquo;re a psychopath without it.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Oh yes! There&rsquo;s an exit! Run, run, run. Excuse me, get out the way! Haha, fucker! The MAIESF can&rsquo;t touch me, they can&rsquo;t catch me. Oh god, the outside air is nice. Move, move, move! Look at all these people going to work, slaving away so that the government can further enslave us. They&rsquo;re like ants, mindlessly following the orders of the queen. Fuck them. They&rsquo;re no better than insects. Fuck insects.</p>

            <p id="stars"> *&emsp; &emsp;* &emsp;&emsp;*</p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Quite a sight, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, mental deviants are always interesting to watch.&rdquo;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The two women watched Mikhael repeatedly slam his head against the wall. For the safety of these physicians, Mikhael was locked in a observation room, unable to attack anyone.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Occasionally he would ramble incoherently. All of his actions were recorded for later analysis. During one of these analysis sessions, the following excerpt was deemed to be especially important:<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a psychopath without it. The ballon popped. You&rsquo;re a psychopath without it. Why am I here?&rdquo;<br />
