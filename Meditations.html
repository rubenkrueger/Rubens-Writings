            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;From the time I rise out of bed to the time I lay down once again, I am only concerned with one thing. This thing often kept me burning the midnight oil, and seldom did I not toss and turn with thoughts of it. For how much I think about it, you would think I loved this thing. But in truth, I hate this thing.
            This thing is the reason why I often stand in the frigid cold of midnight, in a neighborhood where poverty grows faster than weeds in foreclosed homes.
            This thing is not dime bags of crack, nor unregistered guns; it is making money. The drugs and guns are just a means to an end, and I despise both. I hate myself for selling poison to sick people, but this is the best of all bad options.
            I have worked hard for the corner that I sell on, so that’s why this one is less dangerous than others. The new recruits get corners near the boundaries of gang turf, and that is hazardous to one’s health. So I almost have something that I can be proud of.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But the ugly nature of my business shatters my ephemeral pride. Every twenty minutes or so, a sick druggie will hobble over to me and ask for some quantity of the product I sell. Usually this is only a gram or two—just long enough to keep withdrawals at bay for a couple of hours.
            I hate my life and I see no reason for my existence. In fact, it would be best if I were to overdose on heroin, for at least then, I would not be a drain on society’s resources. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However, I am not that lucky.
            Well, it is not entirely true that I am unlucky. I am reminded this everytime I see my reflection in my baby girl’s eyes, everytime she laughs, every time she calls me “da-da.” Her beautiful black hair and smile are all that I live for, but at the same time she makes me resent her mother even more.
            I hope she should have a different life than I. I hope that she has more opportunities, more friends, and more hopes. I wish she didn’t have to sell drugs.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What kind of nation do we live in when people have to sell poison just to get by? Every night the rich man or woman in expensive clothes reports on the economy, on the GDP, and unemployment rate, but I don’t think it means anything to people like me or my brothers or sisters.
            This is why I gotta do, what I gotta do, you know? I hate selling poison, but I just gotta. I get this from my family, who always taught to hustle and grind and fight no matter what, no matter the pain and fear and anger you have built up inside.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“That’s quite the life story, isn’t it?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yes. Yes, it is,” I replied. “Can you see now why I am in this position?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My hands were behind my back, and to speak to her I had to project my voice through the grill that separated the front and back seats.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We continued to talk. She explained her own background, hopes, and failures. The urban landscaped passed us by, without objection.
            I told her that I am truly sorry for what I have done. She wondered if I had asked for forgiveness from God. I asked her how I could possibly be religious, when God has turned his back on me.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“When did he do that?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Well, one time I was incredibly depressed. I was so sad. I tossed and turned at night, unable to remove myself from the horrors of the day. I found no joy in life, even less than I do now, and worse, I did not have my baby girl.
            I do not know why I was so depressed. Although every other night I spent on a park bench in Central Park, and I would go days without a meal, life was, on the whole, not that bad. Back then, selling dope was a lot easier, for they had not put so many narcs down in my area.
            Maybe it was the cold. Yes, that was it. I was perpetually freezing, and this froze my soul.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One day I realized what I should do. Suicide. Except, I was not sure how I should do it.
            Overdose on OxyContin? Heroin? Slit my wrists? A gun? Jump off a bridge? Finally, I had a moment of brilliance. I remembered that my dearly departed brother (rest in peace Trayvon) had left something for me in his safety deposit box.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So there I was, in the bank vault, opening up his box. He had left me a Colt-45 in case I ever needed another gun, and a bottle of Dom Pérignon in the event I was able to leave Harlem. But then, I kid you not, a priest walked in.
            This man, dressed in his “holy” black robes, was huge. He was probably at least six-foot-four, and two hundred and twenty pounds. I don’t know what he was doing there. Priests aren’t supposed to have worldly possessions, are they?<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I tried to stealthily remove the Colt-45 and bottle without him noticing. I was hoping I could then tuck in my pants and leave. But this man, can you believe it, started talking to me about religion and shit. Fuck, can you believe it? Some stranger talking to you about something so personal?
            He started to move closer to me, so I had to put the gun back into the box. He continued to talk about religion, asking me if I believed and whatnot. I gave flimsy answers, as I didn’t want to talk with this man. I eventually abandoned the idea, and left the bank empty-handed.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You know what’s weird?<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“What?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I felt better after that. I don’t know. No, it wasn’t that life got better. I don’t think it was the priest’s sermon. All I know is that I never contemplated suicide again. But I’m still angry at God.
            So God didn’t even allow me to leave this world. Some might say that I don’t get to choose when I leave, since God was the one who put me here. I say fuck that. My mother was raped. While drunk. Did God do that? If he did, fuck him.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Anyways. She was a Latina, in the front seat, with a fiery personality. When I talked to her, I couldn’t actually see her face, but something tells me she understood, she just understood, you know?
            I wonder what made her become a cop, considering she was such a good listener. I wonder if I should ask her. You know what? That’s just what I’ll do.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Why did you become a cop?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She didn’t answer. I asked again.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“For the shiny badge.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I laughed and told her I didn’t believe her. She said she didn’t care. By this point, we had reached Rikers. My journey had finally ended, along with my free life.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Wait, you never told exactly why you needed cash so bad all the time.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; “Oh, sorry. I need it to make bail for the crimes I commit.”<br>
