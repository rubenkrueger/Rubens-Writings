            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;THE LANDSCAPE MIKHAIL saw was breathtaking. Hues of grey, blue, and red coalesced with the blackness of space into the most magnificent sight. And Mikhael was the first man to gaze upon this with naked eyes; in fact, the only man. Am I the only one, he asked to himself, to appreciate this beauty?
            Mikhael played with his glass in amusement. Submerged ice cubes lazily slurred about in the glass. He had been anticipating this moment for years, and now that it had finally been realized, he was not sober enough to fully absorb today’s importance. Even worse, there was work to do. Important work.
            Mikhael rose from his chair (the “Captain’s chair,” as he reminded everyone), to wake up the rest of crew from hibernation. Thankfully the vessel’s onboard computer would do most of the work. Mikhael’s job was more of providing the human touch rather than functionality.
            He was, although he did not realize it, more of a passenger than a crew member…<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The ship’s destination was quickly approaching, but most of the workers were barely leaving the haze of hibernation. The harsh nature of their new reality, though, would force them into wakefulness. Where they were accustomed to months of slumber on the C.S.V. <i>Hyperion</i>,
            most of their future days on the pseudo-hospitable Gaia would consist of exhausting work: setting up the colony, re-establishing contact with the Von Braun, and constructing the prison for the Untermenschen.
            This last item, as Mikhael reminded himself, was the mission’s primary goal. All other tasks and goals were superseded by this, for the expropriation of the underclass from Earth was the mission’s funding source. The morality of this…<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mikhael was interrupted from his reverie by the approach of the <i>Hyperion’s</i> chief engineer, Second Sergeant Alatov Vitaly, who helped himself onto one of the chairs on the vessel’s bridge. Always a cordial man, Alatov began a conversation.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Quite a sight, Captain! How are sleeping beauties?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Not bad, Ally. Only a few minor injuries, according to the Elon.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Elon, the on-board supercomputer, monitored the health of all the crew members (with exception to the Untermenschen, of course) during the duration of their hibernation. It was to be expected that three hundred and seven years of hibernation would have some acute ill effects; however, the long term impacts were not entirely known.
            Anxious to relieve himself of the fifty-six hour watch he just completed, Captain Mikhael ordered Alatov to take watch on the bridge; Alatov, the loyal crew member that he was,  complied.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Even before he had exited the bridge’s automatic doors, Mikhael ingested a small, cinnamon-colored tablet of a benzodiazepine called Tranxene (“trannies,” as it was crudely known). This was done primarily to counteract the effects of the amphetamines Mikhael had been consuming during his shift, but, if he was candid with himself, he was also addicted to them.
            Meandering through the <i>Hyperion’s</i> viscera to his quarters (and then to his bed) would now be a mix of pleasure and drudgery, for the drug slurred his navigational ability but also had euphoric impacts.
            This fact, that Tranxene impairs one’s navigation, is what led him to pass the main cargo bay, for normally none of the crew bothered to pass through this grimy, colosseum-sized depression in the bottom of the ship’s hull. Peering through iron slits, Mikhael observed their main transport, the Untermenschen: thousands of emaciated, pale, and desolate persons wallowing in the stench of death, rotten food, and the hopelessness of their situation.
            Too fatigued to contemplate the ethics of this, Mikhael continued the journey to his bunk, where he ultimately enjoyed the serenity of rest.

        <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: normal;">-vincere est vivere-</h4>

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;THE EARTH HAD circled the Sun twice since the <i>Hyperion</i> landed on Gaia, and progress was ahead of schedule: an interstellar antenna, which would allow the crew on Gaia to finally communicate with the Von Braun, was completed; living quarters, meager agricultural beds (which consisted of potatoes, almonds, and dates), and a rudimentary scientific lab were now enclosed in a polyurethane dome; lastly, and most importantly, a gulag had been erected.
            The greys, blues, and reds which Mikhael marveled at when first viewing Gaia were dying like the tigers, elephants, and corals on Earth; they, the result of atmospheric ammonium nitrates, sulfur dioxides, and silver nitrates, were being siphoned off and replaced with the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide of Terra.
            Mikhael contemplated this with a sense of nostalgia.

        <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: normal;"> -ipso facto-</h4>

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I AM NOT dying, for I have never been alive; I have not been alive for I was not born; I was not born for my mother, the usual source of life, was not alive herself. This iterative denial of the normal cycle of life was the result of our circumstances: the circumstances of slavery, being locked into a cage for three hundred and seven years, and most of all, the depravity of man.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;These thoughts were impossible for an Untermensch to think; in fact, it was a logical absurdity for an Untermensch to think, for it entailed a contradiction: Untermenschen were defined to be a people who could not think.
            So it followed that Untermenschen could not feel, love, nor despair; so it followed that Untermenschen could be arrested (from all lands, across the world), put on an interstellar ship, and transported to a planet far away from Earth; so it followed that no one would care: not the Earthly intellectuals, not Krishna, nor any sort of mythical being which supposedly observed human affairs and keep notes of goods and evils.
            It is important to note that, although the crew members of the <i>Hyperion</i> were put into hibernation during their journey, the Untermenschen were not. Thus, generation after generation lived and died in the same cargo bay.
            To explain their origins, the Untermenschen synthesized their own creation myths, just like the Mayans, Hindus, and Christians of Earth. These stories and fables helped to lessen the profound agony of their bleak existence. Per the writings on the walls of the cargo bay, the Untermenschen came to be like this:<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>Every species is at continual war—conflicting with their oppressors, battling with their fellow organisms, but most of all, fighting an inner struggle with the contradictions of their hearts. It is here where Hyperion, our nourishing mother, seeks to protect us. Hyperion, the omnipotent and omniscient goddess that she is, has ingested us into her and is carrying us away from the filth and horrors of the universe.</i><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The lower levels of the cargo bay feature a language unrecognizable from the writings of the upper heights of the cargo bay, for like any society (if it could be said they had a society), their language evolved. Their language’s evolution, however, was only a shadow of the Untermenschen.

            <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: normal;">-alea iacta est-</h4>

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;IT ROSE IN tight wisps; it was easily dispersed by a gust; it burned as it exited his nostrils. The room spun; he was quiet, introspective, withdrawn; he lost complete orientation of time. His lungs scorched; he began a coughing fit. <i>Fuck</i>, he thought in a haze.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Albeit they had been primarily occupied with work, the former members of the <i>Hyperion</i>—now the “civilized” of Gaia—had occasional leisurely activity. For some, this meant gambling or some other vice. For Mikhael, he chose one of his favorites from high school.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A wave washed over him, and he was overcome with the desire to eat. It was not a physical hunger, but an emotional hunger, instigated by the psychotropics. So he rose from his bunk to begin the journey to communal mess hall.
            The narrow passages of the dome (their permanent home) seemed to constrict him. They closed in on him, refused him breath, and oppressed him. The walls hated him, and wanted him to fail in life. So he began to run, escaping their grip.
            He passed some of his colleagues without notice, most of whom were absorbed in some sort of electronic device. Taking a left at the communal showers, and then a right at the emergency aid station, he was now at his destination.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The entrance to the mess hall was a set of double doors which opened and closed with a self-important woosh. However, a small throng of people were assembled before the doors, jeering and cheering.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“The hell you mean you bet 12, eh? You bloody bastard!” One jaunty British man exclaimed.
            They were playing some sort of game with dice and poker chips; Mikhael was too high to discern what exactly was happening. He also forgot why he came here, so he remained there, watching the crowd.
            They kept playing, the men and women, who ranged in age from those the same age as Mikhael to those in their fifties (the oldest of any of the crew). Suddenly, an argument broke out.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Don’t be a cunt, and pay what you put down,” a lithe man with blonde hair and silver streaks yelled.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I didn’t bet anything,” replied his interlocutor, a rotund man in a coat of perspiration.
            Whether it was the pressure of working twenty-hour days or the excitability of the crowd that made be the situation so hostile, Mikhael did not know, but at any rate the two men began fighting. The corpulent man was on top the other, landing blows all over his body. Shouting obscenities, the smaller man managed to wrangle free and dove for his opponent’s legs. With this turn of the tables, the mob roared with enthusiasm. Mikhael enjoyed the spectacle; it was some excitement for his trip.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;An older woman, whom Mikhael had never seen before, appeared. No one else noticed her. She just stood there a few feet away, like him, watching the brawl. She was pastel-white and rather gaunt. Both men by now were thoroughly fatigued and reduced to half-hearted kicks and punches.
            Turning to him, she held out her hand. In it was a red object, the size and shape of a coin. She did not speak, but motioned to him to take it. With perked interest, he accepted it. It was heavy, with a metallic texture, and there were six dots on both faces of it.
            The woman broke the silence with a cryptic message: “The die has been cast.”
            Mikhael continued to watch the fight with the strange object in his hand. When he turned to where the woman once was he could not see her.


            <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: normal;">-ad lucem-</h4>

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I FEEL BROKEN; I am alone; I am adrift, on a raft, in the middle of the ocean.
            Maybe it was the alcohol, maybe it was the muscle relaxers, maybe it was the combination of them at the same time, but Mikhael felt like dying. He hated himself so much, it was like a truncheon tearing at his insides.
            The gin and tonic, he knew, worsened his mental health; yet, when the crushing pointlessness of life and his complete inability to gain meaningful relationships came back like shadows under the sun he could not help himself.
            His head pounded. <i>Fuck.</i>
            He puked. <i>Fuck my life.</i>
            He knocked back another drink. <i>Why I am doing this to myself?</i>
            It was an unbreakable cycle of despair, substance abuse, and short-lived attempts at recovery. He knew this. He understood this better than anyone.<br><br>

            <div id="stars">*  &emsp; *  &emsp;  * &emsp; * &emsp; *</div><br>

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Stop doing that,” the physician told Mikhael, who then replied with a curt insult.
            Life on Gaia was hard: keeping the Untermenschen pacified, collecting scientific data, and converting the planet into one more like Earth took a toll on the crew, especially Mikhael, who was now in the infirmary for a drug overdose.
            The physician was performing some odd test or another when the lights flickered.
            The lights never flickered.
            “What the hell was that,” the physician exclaimed with noted worry. Mikhael, on the other hand, was amused.
            From an air vent above, the creature appeared. He (or she) was emaciated and pale. He stood on two legs like a man, but was most certainly not a man.
            The creature leaped at the physician, eating him alive in front of Mikhael, who was paralyzed with fear.
            The creature then grabbed Mikhael and brought him out into the environment of Gaia. Mikhael was then forced to watch the horde of Untermenschen destroy equipment, people, and all of their progress.

            <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: normal;">-author’s note-</h4>

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;THE UNTERMENSCHEN HAD for decades (well, as best they could determine what was decades, given the difficulty of measuring time while traveling at relativistic speeds), been planning the downfall of the crew. It was inevitable, given the horror of their situation.
            What is peculiar, however, is that the Von Braun had assisted in this process.
            This is just another example of why one cannot trust humans, nor sub-humans, nor even sentient machines.
